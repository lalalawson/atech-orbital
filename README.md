# Team: A.Tech

Orbital 2020 Team A.Tech (Yongler & Lawson)

## App: purrductive
<i> Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11 </i>



## Motivation
As University level students, we are more often than not, overloaded with work. There are tutorials piling up, exams every now and then, and webcasts to catch up on. Even with this overwhelming stress, we often find ourselves in a slump, where there is no motivation to start work at all. It can be very tough to be productive sometimes when discipline seems to be missing. I'm sure this is an apparent problem that many students (of course including ourselves), and even working adults face. After all, we are only human, and it is not uncommon to hit productivity slumps, especially with all sorts of distractions running amock our daily lives. 

Often times, we find ourselves thinking, with all these apps that serve to distract us, wouldn't it be great if there was an application that motivated us to be productive instead? An app that asssists us in organizing our workload, an app that actually makes us want to focus.


 

## Aim
A.Tech is planning to make a one-stop mobile productivity app called "purrductive" that aims to boost the user's productivity by giving them motivation to clear their tasks at hand.



## User Stories 

1. As a student who has an ever-growing number of tutorials, CCAs, projects and exams, I want to be able to have an overview of my priorities and tasks at hand easily.

2. As a student who is revising for exams, I want to be able to stay focused.

3. As a worker who has a consistent amount of workload daily, I would like to minimize distractions during working hours.

4. As a user of the app, I hope that there is a reward system to motivate me to use the app to keep in focus. 



## Scope of Project

Our app attempts to solve the problems at hand via various functions take work together.

The app is mainly looking at helping and encouraging users to stay on task, tied in with a unique twist by including our gamification system as well as a splash of adorable pixel art! We are currently using Flutter to create our application.

Here are some of the functionalities we are intending to incoporate: 

Firstly, we intend to have a simple to-do list, allowing users to organize their tasks efficiently and have a quick overview. This allows users to zoom in quickly on priority targets. 

Current implemented to do list:

Then, we will introduce users to our pomodoro timer, which helps the users split their workload into short 25mins focus sprints, followed by a 5-10mins break in between. This cycle is also known as 1 pomodoro, and after 4 pomodoros, users will be prompted for a 15-30mins break. (Users will also have the flexibility to edit their preferred timings if required). The illusion of a 'deadline' tend to encourages users to focus on the task and hand, and also helps to break large amount of work into more digestable bite sizes. 

Current proposed timer page:

Next, we intend to incentivize our users for focusing and clearing off tasks through gamification of our app. As you probably would have noticed, there is a cute animal on the screenshots of our app. The animal is actually your companion! We are intending to incorporate plenty of cute pixelated sprites into our app to serve as your companion! Afterall, it can be more encouraging to focus with someone at time! You are greeted by your companion everytime you login, and they remind you of your tasks at hand. 

Current proposed homepage:

Everytime users clear a pomodoro, or their very own custom focus session, or when they clear a task at hand, they get awarded with in-game currency. With that currency, they get to unlock different avatars of their liking, purchase accessories for their avatars, or even decorate the avatar's home! 

Additionally, we have implemented focus function whereby the user's focus session would be prematurely terminated if the app is exited or the user decides to use his/her phone.

## Uniqueness (How are we different from similar platforms?)

1. To-Do Lists in the App Store (Any.do / Tasks / Todoist / Google Tasks) 
 - Most to-do lists in the app store are great at sorting out your work, but they do not give you the incentive to. You might use it for a week or two at max and gradually forget about your list. We plan to provide an incentive for you to use your to-do list, and give you satisfaction when you check off tasks! 
 
2. Productivity Timers / Trackers in App Store
 - Most timers are great and gets the job done. But similar problem arises when you lack incentive to start timing yourself. We want to provide users with the excitement and 'want' to start their work, so that they have higher morale and better focus. Similarly, we want to provide a one-stop productive app by merging to-dos and timers.
